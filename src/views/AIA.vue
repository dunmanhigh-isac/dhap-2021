                    <div class="text-20 weight-300 w-full text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">The December 1995 ASEAN Summit endorsed the concept of the ASEAN Investment Area Council (AIA), which works towards lowering barriers for regional investment. By aiming for the establishment of a ASEAN single market and sustaining the inflow of investment and reinvestment, AIA seeks to promote the dynamic development of ASEAN economies. Delegates will be challenged to come up with measures to ensure continued economic cooperation between ASEAN member states to facilitate a competitive investment environment in ASEAN.</div>

                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">Economic integration refers to an agreement between countries or a bloc of countries aimed at reducing or eliminating trade barriers, as well as coordinating monetary and fiscal policies, in order to increase trade among involved parties. The recent signing of the worldâ€™s largest trade pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) which was spearheaded by ASEAN, is an indicator of the success of regional cooperation beyond ASEAN. To further regional economic development, ASEAN has to remain united in tackling the uncertainties and challenges arising from geo-strategic shifts in a constantly evolving post-pandemic world. Delegates will have to navigate the tricky waters of trade deals while protecting the interests of their own economies.

                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">A special economic zone (SEZ) is an area in a country that is subject to different economic regulations than other regions within the same country that facilitate investments, especially Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Specialized economic zones have also been developed in ASEAN Member States with the aim to attract specific industries, technology and knowledge-based activities aligned with the locational strengths of the zone or country. However, the further development and establishment of SEZs has also been hindered by trends of increasing populations, increasing affluence and urbanisation as well as climate change. Delegates will be challenged to come up with novel and innovative solutions to combat these issues.
