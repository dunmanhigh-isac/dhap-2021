                    <div class="text-20 weight-300 w-full text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">In 1997, the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime, or AMMTC for short, was set up after the endorsement of the ASEAN Declaration on Transnational Crime. In their fight against transnational crime, the AMMTC meets at least once every 2 years to address pressing issues such as drug trafficking and terrorism in Southeast Asia. The importance of AMMTC is highlighted by the proliferation of various transnational crimes as a result of the rise of globalisation. As such, delegates will be required to critically analyse and come up with solutions for the various security issues ASEAN faces.</div>

                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">As borders become increasingly obsolete today, many criminal organisations have seized this opportunity to maximise their profits and influence. Consequently, transnational criminal operations, such as drug and human trafficking, have been gaining traction in ASEAN. Given the involvement of multiple countries in such crimes, the extradition of criminals surfaces as a key point of contention. However, the process of extradition is often complicated by differences in legislation and cultural norms of nations. Thus, delegates will have to analyse the political and social contexts of their respective nations while balancing domestic and regional needs when discussing the standardisation of extradition laws within ASEAN.

                    <div class="weight-500 text-36 text-center">Response to Domestic Terrorism</div>
                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">Given the rise in terrorist attacks around the world, ASEAN has placed emphasis on developing a regional counter-terrorism approach to strengthen regional security. The actions taken by ASEAN include the 2007 ASEAN Convention on Counter-Terrorism and the 2009 ASEAN Comprehensive Plan of Action on Counter-Terrorism, which aim to prevent and suppress terrorism within ASEAN by encouraging regional cooperation and research.
Yet, there remain insufficiencies that undermine the effectiveness of such measures, as seen from the continued presence of terrorist groups like the Jemaah Islamiyah and the Daesh in Southeast Asian countries. Moreover, terrorists have also capitalised on technological tools to radicalise individuals.
Therefore, delegates are to analyse and build on current ASEAN policies while coming up with innovative and effective solutions that can better address the threat of domestic terrorism.
