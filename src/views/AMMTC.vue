                        <div class="text-20 weight-400 w-full text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">In 1997, the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime, or AMMTC for short, was set up after the endorsement of the ASEAN Declaration on Transnational Crime. In their fight against transnational crime, the AMMTC meets at least
                            once every 2 years to address pressing issues such as drug trafficking and terrorism in Southeast Asia. The importance of AMMTC is highlighted by the proliferation of various transnational crimes as a result of the rise of globalisation.
                            As such, delegates will be required to critically analyse and come up with solutions for the various security issues ASEAN faces.</div>

                        <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">As borders become increasingly obsolete today, many criminal organisations have seized this opportunity to maximise their profits and influence. Consequently, transnational criminal operations, such as drug and human trafficking, have
                            been gaining traction in ASEAN. Given the involvement of multiple countries in such crimes, the extradition of criminals surfaces as a key point of contention. However, the process of extradition is often complicated by differences
                            in legislation and cultural norms of nations. Thus, delegates will have to analyse the political and social contexts of their respective nations while balancing domestic and regional needs when discussing the standardisation of
                            extradition laws within ASEAN.

                        <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">Despite the dream of a Drug-Free ASEAN that was envisioned over 20 years ago, the problem of drug trafficking continues to grow in prominence - with more than 350,000 cases in 2019 alone. Given the wide-reaching repercussions of this
                            illicit trade, it is crucial for ASEAN to take further action to curb the prevalence of drug trafficking. Yet, the increasingly sophisticated methods used to smuggle drugs, coupled with deeply rooted corruption and the lack of
                            political enforcement, have greatly heightened the difficulty of tackling this issue. As such, delegates are tasked with formulating multifaceted solutions to curb drug trafficking within ASEAN.
