Taking the formation of a joint council this year,
                            this committee is created specifically for Model UNs, and seeks to simulate the complexity and thrill of past crises while encouraging delegates to create their own storyline to explore alternative historical courses.</div>

                        <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">This year’s rendition of HCC will see delegates going back in time to the outbreak of the Iraq War in 2003 - a pivotal event that would shape the relations between the West and Middle East for years to come. In this council, delegates
                            will plunge headfirst into the vicious combat of advancing their national interests, while considering the legality of the actions taken by all parties. Skills like critical thinking and adaptability will be tested as delegates
                            navigate their way through this controversial and convoluted war, and ultimately try to restore world peace.

                                <div class="text-18" style="line-height: 1.2;">Just like any other Y6 student, Jemma has found herself facing more existential CRISES than ever this year, trying to keep up with her (mounting) commitments while ensuring she still makes time for good food and conversations with her loved ones. She is beyond honoured and excited to take on this new role of chairing a crisis council, and wishes for delegates to have nothing but fun and a fruitful time at DHAP this year - over Discord of course :)</div>

When she is not rushing to finish her tutorial a day before submission, you can find her binge watching K-dramas and surfing through the internet (even though she knows that she has no time to slack). Lastly, Mana hopes that all delegates will have a fun and fruitful time during DHAP this year:)</div>

She also takes pride in being an INFP, and looks forward to meeting others with the same personality trait! Relatively new to MUN and also a first-time chair, Chloe has no idea how she ended up directing a Crisis council. Nonetheless, she is grateful to have a great partner and is honoured to have this opportunity. She hopes that delegates would learn as much as she did from this crisis and that they would enjoy it as much as she did too. Lastly, she wishes that all delegates would have a fruitful and enriching experience from this year’s DHAP!</div>

Aside from dragging her (rather unwilling) friends into thought-provoking discussions, she can be found reading in libraries or wandering around Singapore.

Joseph thus seeks simpler pleasures life has to offer, such as food, sleep and lots of sugar. On the bright side (thankfully), MUNs and great peer support is what keeps his sanity. Overall, he sincerely hopes all that delegates will reap meaningful discussions and forge friendships during DHAP 2021.</div>

Dorthy never fails to involve herself in extracurriculars which piqued her interest in mun and also explains the obscene amount of commitments she has (and is drowning in) Priding herself on her humour, Dorthy hopes to make DHAP a fun-filled time for delegates and can’t wait to meet everyone!</div>
