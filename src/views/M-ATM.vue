                    <div class="text-20 weight-300 w-full text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">The ASEAN Tourism Ministers’ Meeting, otherwise known as the M-ATM, had its first meeting in 1998. Since then, the council has strived to facilitate cooperation within ASEAN’s tourism sector, market the ASEAN region as a collective tourist destination and facilitate intra-ASEAN travel. Tourism is a critical sector of ASEAN’s economy - accounting for 14.3% of ASEAN’s GDP in 2020.</div>

                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">Tourism has undoubtedly been one of the biggest victims of Covid-19. Given the devastating loss of tourism revenue, the livelihoods of many are at great risk. Despite the seemingly gloomy circumstances, this could prove to be a valuable opportunity to strengthen ASEAN’s position as a competitive, sustainable and more integrated tourism destination.
This begs the question - how can ASEAN minimise Covid-19 repercussions while pursuing her vision for ASEAN tourism? Moreover, how can ASEAN develop her tourism scene while ensuring no country or group gets left behind?
Delegates will be required to answer these questions when discussing how best to restore ASEAN’s tourism industry.

                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States, cultural heritage tourism is defined as the “people travelling to experience the places, artifacts and activities which represent the stories and people of the past”. There are several issues facing this category of tourism. A notable one is funding, which results in a lack of infrastructure, especially in developing countries within ASEAN. An example is less developed transport infrastructure which may discourage potential tourists from coming to the country. Another issue is the enhancement of the marketing of ASEAN as a single tourist destination to boost ASEAN’s competitiveness in the tourism sphere. Delegates will be tasked to come up with solutions that best address these issues.
