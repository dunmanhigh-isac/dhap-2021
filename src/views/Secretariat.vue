Most of the time though, she prefers to chill with her friends and family or drawing to her heart's content.</div>

A massive nerd, she likes to design powerpoint slides for fun and writes angsty poetry when distressed. She is also severely sleep deprived. Please send help.</div>

                                <div class="text-18" style="line-height: 1.2;">Hsin Yu is one of those slightly crazy #YOLO students that have dived into way too many commitments. A food enthusiast, she enjoys taking pictures of food before every meal. She is permanently sleep-deprived and constantly tired but food might be the only thing that gets her through long school days. She hopes that delegates will have an enriching and one-of-a-kind experience at this year’s online edition of DHAP.</div>

                                <div class="text-18 text-left lg:text-right" style="line-height: 1.2;">Now in her sixth year at Dunman High, Lecia is still learning the act of juggling commitments and keeping up with the seemingly never-ending, fast-paced lectures and tutorials. Passionate about both the humanities and sciences, she is a PCME student who tries her best to believe that there are exceptions to the "Do What You Love" rhetoric. A veteran of (barely) functioning with less than four hours of sleep, she is also experienced at battling enemies in PUBG and sleepiness during lectures. Thanks to Covid-19, her hopes of chairing a DHAP council are dashed. However, Lecia has developed a newfound passion to contribute to the organising of DHAP to the best of her abilities, and hopes that delegates will enjoy a fulfilling MUN experience at DHAP 2021.</div>

                                <div class="text-18" style="line-height: 1.2;">Li Xuan is a year 6 student who is still in denial about being in Senior High. Aside from dragging her (rather unwilling) friends into thought-provoking discussions, she can be found reading in libraries or wandering around Singapore. Li Xuan hopes that delegates will have a fun time in DHAP!</div>

                                <div class="text-18 text-left lg:text-right" style="line-height: 1.2;">Just like what the council's name states, Joseph has to confess that life now is nothing but a crisis. Joseph thus seeks simpler pleasures life has to offer, such as food, sleep and lots of sugar. On the bright side (thankfully), MUNs and great peer support is what keeps his sanity. Overall, he sincerely hopes that all delegates will reap meaningful discussions and forge friendships during DHAP 2021.</div>
