It seeks to maintain international peace and security, as well as facilitate cooperation among nations in solving international problems and disputes. Here, delegates take on the role of diplomats from the 15 member states of the council, working together to respond to longstanding threats to global security as well as crises that would disrupt the peace. Additionally, they will be taken back to 2014 to seek a peaceful resolution to one of the most contentious issues of the year.</div>

                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">On 18 March 2014, the Treaty on Accession of the Republic of Crimea to Russia was signed between the representatives of the Republic of Crimea and the Russian Federation. This formed a contentious conclusion to a tumultuous five months in Ukraine with issues like President Viktor Yanukovych’s reign, the self-declared independence of the Republic of Crimea, and the deployment of Russian troops within Ukrainian territory. As such, this topic shines the spotlight on the concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Given how Russia has already vetoed a previous council draft resolution seeking to void a referendum declaring the Republic of Crimea’s independence, the council will now have to tactically manoeuvre towards a resolution. With both Ukraine and Russia maintaining a military presence around the contentious region, delegates must work together to de-escalate tensions and do their utmost for a peaceful solution.
