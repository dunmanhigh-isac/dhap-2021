It seeks to maintain international peace and security, as well as facilitate cooperation between various nations to international problems and disputes. Delegates take on the role as the diplomats of the 15 member states of the council, working together to respond to longstanding threats to global security as well as crises that would disrupt the peace. Additionally, they will be taken back to 2014, where they can expect to handle one of, if not the most contentious events of the year, and work together to seek a peaceful resolution.</div>

                    <div class="text-20 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">On 18 March 2014, the Treaty on Accession of the Republic of Crimea to Russia was signed between the representatives of the Republic of Crimea and the Russian Federation, forming a contentious conclusion to a tumultuous 5 months in Ukraine. Following uncertainty and controversy regarding issues like President Viktor Yanukovych’s reign, the self-declared independence of the Republic of Crimea, and the deployment of Russian troops within Ukrainian territory, this topic shines the spotlight on the concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity. With Russia having already vetoed a previous council draft resolution seeking to void a referendum declaring the Republic of Crimea’s independence, the council will now have to tactically and carefully manoeuvre towards a resolution. With both Ukraine and Russia maintaining a military presence around the contentious region, the pressure is on the Security Council to work towards a peaceful resolution.
