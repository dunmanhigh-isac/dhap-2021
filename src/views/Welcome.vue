          Dear Sir/Madam,
        </div>
        <div class="text-20 weight-300 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">
          On behalf of the organising committee of the Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP) 2021, I sincerely invite your institution to DHAP 2021. DHAP is the flagship event of the International and Strategic Affairs Council (ISAC), held in conjunction with the Humanities Department of Dunman High School, with a unique focus on ASEAN. Here, participants take on the roles of diplomatic leaders of ASEAN nations and international players while discussing pertinent regional and international issues.

          This year, our theme for DHAP 2021 is “From Unity, Strength”. After decades of globalisation, the world appears to be fragmenting at an unprecedented rate, epitomised best by the return of protectionism and treaty withdrawals. Multilateralism is in crisis, at a time where the need for international cooperation is more urgent than ever before. At this critical juncture, international unity is a beacon of hope that is capable of furthering diplomacy and encouraging global effort to tackle the multifaceted issues of today. Only then can we find strength, both as a region and as a world, to overcome current and future challenges together. Ultimately, the robustness of a community greatly depends on the cohesiveness of its members. We hope that by participating in DHAP 2021, delegates will get the valuable opportunity to verify this for themselves.

          Now into our 14th year running, we are delighted to introduce our Guest-of-Honour...

        <div class="text-20 weight-300 text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">
          In light of Covid-19 restrictions, we have devised the very first online rendition of DHAP to continue providing delegates with a platform to delve into rigorous academic discussions on both regional and global issues. From 2 June (Wednesday) to 4 June 2021 (Friday), we are expecting to host approximately 100 delegates aged 14 to 18 from both local and international institutions in our first ever online conference. Through DHAP, we hope that delegates can go beyond simply learning about global matters, and cultivate a deeper appreciation for intergovernmental organisation. I sincerely hope that all delegates will gain both useful skills and strong friendships through the three-day conference that will empower them to become future leaders of change.

          With that, I wish every delegate an enriching experience at DHAP 2021!
